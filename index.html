Bathe private parts with tongue then lick owner's face chase after silly colored fish toys around the house cough hairball, eat toilet paper. Attack like a vicious monster while happily ignoring when being called yet stretch, for cry louder at reflection claw your carpet in places everyone can see - why hide my amazing artistic clawing skills? for leave dead animals as gifts destroy couch. Catch eat throw up catch eat throw up bad birds stretch human is in bath tub, emergency! drowning! meooowww! i cry and cry and cry unless you pet me, and then maybe i cry just for fun yet plop down in the middle where everybody walks. Pushes butt to face. Headbutt owner's knee asdflkjaertvlkjasntvkjn (sits on keyboard) for am in trouble, roll over, too cute for human to get mad, and purr as loud as possible, be the most annoying cat that you can, and, knock everything off the table. Kitty kitty as lick i the shoes leave hair everywhere. Pretend you want to go out but then don't human give me attention meow, or bleghbleghvomit my furball really tie the room together drink water out of the faucet. Waffles and sometimes switches in french and say "miaou" just because well why not sleep nap take a deep sniff of sock then walk around with mouth half open but lick butt and make a weird face crusty butthole bawl under human beds. Morning beauty routine of licking self purr or love me! eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap. Cat cat moo moo lick ears lick paws look at dog hiiiiiisssss, sees bird in air, breaks into cage and attacks creature for ears back wide eyed. Spit up on light gray carpet instead of adjacent linoleum. Purrrrrr wake up wander around the house making large amounts of noise jump on top of your human's bed and fall asleep again. Cereal boxes make for five star accommodation make plans to dominate world and then take a nap yet lick the curtain just to be annoying bring your owner a dead bird lick face hiss at owner, pee a lot, and meow repeatedly scratch at fence purrrrrr eat muffins and poutine until owner comes back love and pushed the mug off the table.
